# Cloud-Resume-Challenge-Infra
Greetings! Here you'll find all the IaC and Backend files pertaining to my take on Forrest Brazeal's Cloud Resume Challenge-Google Cloud version.
It has taken me months to complete the challenge, however, I believe the extra time spent soaking up cloud fundamentals and best practices is well worth it.
I learned how to setup VSCode with my GitHub repositories, implement Google Cloud's Workforce Identity Federation service to securely grant GitHub Actions access to resources, also how to manipulate databases using python.
